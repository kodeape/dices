# Dices!!!
Dices!!! is a website on which you can roll many different dice. Yes, I am aware that "dices" isn't a word. Don't @ me haters.

Live and ready to use and abuse at http://folk.ntnu.no/sarargh/dices/

The Arduino file is a simpler version of dices!!! implemented on an Arduino. It shouldn't really be here, it's not connected to the website at all.

## Note to any employers who might see this
I wrote this program in 2017, and it was last updated early 2018. Please don't judge it too hard. It's quite ugly, but near and dear to my heart.
